              <br/>
                <p>ADAP-BIG is a free cross-platform software for processing 
                  raw untargeted mass spectrometry data, designed to handle large numbers
                  of samples on machines with minimal system requirements.
                  Users can choose between two workflows for processing 
                  liquid chromatography (LC-) and gas chromatography-mass 
                  spectrometry (GC-MS) data. The graphical user interface allows 
                  users to visualize the raw data and intermediate results along 
                  each step of the data processing.</p>
                <p>ADAP-BIG is brought to you by <a href="http://www.du-lab.org/" target="_blank">Du-Lab</a></p>
